 <h2> TechStack used </h2>
 <li> Django Framework </li>
 <li>  CSS, Bootstrap </li>
 <li> Basic Javascript</li>
 
 <h2> Motivation  </h2>
  Regular restaurants have staff for waiters and orders are taken manually. Imagine if you want to have lunch or dinner but under the following circumstances:
  <li> Stuck in traffic and extremely hungry followed by , </li>
  <li> Time taken by waiter to entertain you and communicate your order, </li>
  <li> Time to prepare the meal starts after you reach which wastes time .</li>
  <li> By the time the meal is served , excess time is wasted. </li>
  
  So was the case in our college canteen. The travelling time from classrooms to the canteen could be used to place the order so that students don't spend half of their precious Lunch break standing in long queues.
  
 <h2> Solution </h2>
    <li>A  website which takes your order beforehand and serve you on your desired time of arrival </li>
    <li>It remembers your details and orders in a Database </li>
    <li> Reduces labour costs for manager and waiters.</li>
    <li> Scheduling the order at a certain time decreases the waiting time  and load at canteens/restaurants </li>.
